MultiDataPull Schema -

MultiDataPull is designed to be a modular way to implement data collection
based on common scheduling, such as daily, weekly, every thirty minutes, etc. 

The modules can be implemented as part of the MultiDataPull Main program, or
individually as cron jobs or scheduled tasks. 

Because of the young nature of the program, it will probably change
significantly as versions iterate. Please bear with the process.
